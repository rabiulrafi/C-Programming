Step by step descriptive logic to remove element from array.

1. Move to the specified location which you want to remove in given array.
2. Copy the next element to the current element of array. Which is you need to perform array[i] = array[i + 1].
3. Repeat above steps till last element of array.
4 .Finally decrement the size of array by one



Step by step descriptive logic to search element in array using linear search algorithm.

1. Input size and elements in array from user. Store it in some variable say size and arr.
2. Input number to search from user in some variable say toSearch.
3. Define a flag variable as found = 0. I have initialized found with 0, which means initially I have assumed that searched element does not exists in array.
4. Run loop from 0 to size. Loop structure should look like for(i=0; i<size; i++).
5. Inside loop check if current array element is equal to searched number or not. Which is if(arr[i] == toSearch) then set found = 1 flag and terminate from loop. Since element is found no need to continue further.
6. Outside loop if(found == 1) then element is found otherwise not.
